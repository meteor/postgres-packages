# Postgres Packages

Elephants don't fly, most of the time.

This is a heavily work in progress experimental exploration of what it would
look like to use Postgres (and by extension, other SQL-like databases) with
Meteor. Expect a lot of stuff to be broken for now until we announce that it's
ready for usage.

To see the patterns we are working on, check out the guide here:

Tell use what you think on the [forum
